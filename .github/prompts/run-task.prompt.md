# Task Pipeline — Agent Orchestrator

Execute the target roadmap task through its full tier-appropriate SDLC pipeline. Each phase has a lead role, a prompt guide, and a quality gate that must pass before advancing.

Use TodoWrite to track phase progress throughout.

---

## Step 1 — Load Task

Read `docs/specs/implementation-roadmap.md` and find the task row matching the target task ID. Extract:

| Field               | Source Column                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Task ID             | #                                |
| Name                | Task                             |
| Story Points        | SP                               |
| Priority            | Priority (Must / Should / Could) |
| Layer               | Layer                            |
| Dependencies        | Depends on                       |
| Requirements Trace  | Trace                            |
| Acceptance Criteria | Done when                        |
| Sprint Number       | Section header                   |
| Wave Number         | Execution waves table            |

Also read `docs/specs/mvp-requirements.md` to resolve the Trace column to full requirement text.

### Load Stack Profile

Read `docs/specs/stack.md` — the active stack profile. It defines the language/framework commands and per-layer conventions this pipeline invokes by reference (validation, data access, migrations, access control, module structure, auth, dependency audit, deploy). Wherever a phase below names a concrete command or convention, use the value from the stack profile. If a referenced field is marked `N/A`, skip that check. If `docs/specs/stack.md` is missing, **STOP** and ask the user to create it from `docs/specs/stack-template.md`.

### Load Lessons Learned

Read all existing task output files in `.ai/sprints/sprint-{N}/tasks/*.md` (where N is the target sprint). For each file, extract the **Human Interventions** section and compile a list of lessons. These lessons are corrections from prior task executions and **must** be applied during this task's pipeline — repeating a previously corrected mistake is a pipeline failure.

If this is not Sprint 0, also read `.ai/sprints/sprint-{N-1}/retrospective.md` for cross-sprint lessons.

If no prior task outputs exist, proceed without lessons.

---

## Step 2 — Classify Tier

| SP  | Tier     | Pipeline                      |
| --- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1–2 | Light    | ① → ③ → ④ → ⑧                 |
| 3   | Standard | ① → ② → ③ → ④ → ⑤ → ⑧         |
| 5–8 | Complex  | ① → ② → ③ → ④ → ⑤ → ⑥ → ⑦ → ⑧ |

**Override rules** — upgrade to next tier minimum when:

- Layer is `auth` or task involves security-sensitive logic
- Trace includes `NFR-6.*` (GDPR/compliance)
- Flagged as sprint risk in the roadmap
- Sprint 6 hardening task

Read the matching tier workflow:

- Light: `.ai/workflows/tier-light.md`
- Standard: `.ai/workflows/tier-standard.md`
- Complex: `.ai/workflows/tier-complex.md`

Also read `.ai/workflows/task-pipeline.md` for phase definitions and the agent routing matrix.

---

## Step 3 — Create Feature Branch

Read `.github/git-workflow.md` for branching conventions, including the **Commit Checkpoint** rule: the agent never runs `git add`/`git commit` on the changeset — it presents a plan and the human commits. This rule applies at every phase where work lands on the branch (Phase ③ initial commit, Phase ④ blocker fixes, Phase ⑧ any verification tweaks).

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<sprint>.<task>-<slug>
```

Use the task's layer to determine the `<type>` (e.g., `feat` for new functionality, `chore` for infra/ci, `docs` for documentation). Use the task ID for `<sprint>.<task>` and derive a short slug from the task name.

---

## Step 4 — Check Dependencies

Verify every entry in the task's `Depends on` column is complete:

- Check git log and existing code for evidence of prior task completion
- Verify expected artifacts exist (files, schemas, routes, tables)

If any dependency is unmet: **STOP** — report exactly which task(s) must complete first and what evidence is missing.

---

## Step 5 — Execute Pipeline

### Agent model by tier

| Tier             | Execution model                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Light (1–2 SP)   | **Single agent** — run all phases inline, reading each role file to shift perspective      |
| Standard (3 SP)  | **Sub-agent per phase** — spawn a dedicated agent for each active phase via the Agent tool |
| Complex (5–8 SP) | **Sub-agent per phase** — spawn a dedicated agent for each active phase via the Agent tool |

**Single-agent phases** (Light tier): Read the role file, execute the phase, check the gate, then move on to the next phase within the same conversation context.

**Sub-agent phases** (Standard/Complex tiers): For each active phase, spawn a sub-agent with a prompt that includes:

1. The role file path and guide file path to read
2. The Task Brief (and Design Spec if produced)
3. The phase-specific instructions from this prompt
4. The quality gate criteria
5. Any prior phase artifacts the sub-agent needs as input

The orchestrator (this agent) passes artifacts between sub-agents and checks each gate before spawning the next phase. On gate failure, re-spawn the sub-agent with the failure context and remediation instructions.

---

### Phase ① — Analyze

> All tiers

**Role**: `.ai/roles/business-analyst.md`
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/analyze-task.md`

1. Resolve the Trace column to full EARS requirement text from `docs/specs/mvp-requirements.md`
2. Convert "Done when" into specific, testable acceptance criteria
3. Confirm tier classification against override rules
4. For Complex tier: pull architectural constraints from `docs/architecture/` ADRs
5. Identify ambiguities, missing information, or risks
6. Determine Nx scope tags involved and verify boundary implications

**Output**: Task Brief — use the format defined in `.ai/prompts/analyze-task.md`

**Quality Gate**: Present the Task Brief.

**PAUSE — Wait for human confirmation before proceeding.**

---

### Phase ② — Design

> Standard + Complex only. Light tier skips to Phase ③.

**Role**: `.ai/roles/architect.md` + layer co-designer (see table in `.ai/prompts/design-spec.md`)
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/design-spec.md`

1. Read the Task Brief from Phase ①
2. Consult `docs/architecture/` for relevant ADRs and design patterns
3. Read `.ai/standards/architecture.md` and `.ai/standards/nx-boundaries.md`
4. Identify all files to create or modify — with full paths
5. Define interfaces, schemas, or contracts at component boundaries using the stack profile's **Validation / contracts** mechanism
6. Map data flow (consider a Mermaid sequence diagram for Complex tier)
7. Verify Nx boundary compliance — which `scope:*` tags are involved
8. Define test strategy (what to test, where, fixtures needed)
9. For Complex tier: determine if an ADR is needed (new pattern, new dependency, new trade-off)

**Output**: Design Spec — use the format defined in `.ai/prompts/design-spec.md`

**Quality Gate**:

- **Complex tier**: **PAUSE — Present Design Spec for human approval**
- **Standard tier**: auto-proceed unless architectural risk is flagged (new pattern or boundary change)

---

### Phase ③ — Implement

> All tiers

**Role**: Route by layer per the agent routing matrix in `.ai/workflows/task-pipeline.md`. Read the matching role file from `.ai/roles/`:

| Layer                                 | Primary Role File                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `monorepo`, `frontend`, `api`, `auth` | `.ai/roles/implementer.md`       |
| `database`                            | `.ai/roles/database-engineer.md` |
| `ai`                                  | `.ai/roles/ai-engineer.md`       |
| `infra`, `ci`                         | `.ai/roles/devops.md`            |
| `testing`                             | `.ai/roles/qa.md`                |

For `auth` layer, also consult `.ai/roles/security-engineer.md` in an advisory capacity.

**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/implement.md`
**Standards**: `.ai/standards/coding.md`, `.ai/standards/testing.md`

**Input**: Task Brief (Light tier) or Design Spec (Standard/Complex tier)

1. **Read first** — read all relevant existing source files before changing anything
2. **Scaffold** — use the stack profile's **Scaffold** command for new libs/modules where applicable
3. **Build** — implement following the spec. Respect:
   - `.ai/standards/coding.md` for code conventions
   - `.ai/standards/nx-boundaries.md` for module boundaries
   - the stack profile's **Module / layer structure** for the relevant layer
4. **Test** — write co-located tests at tier-appropriate depth:
   - **Light**: minimal — contract validation per the stack profile's **Validation / contracts** mechanism (schema validates, export resolves)
   - **Standard**: unit tests for all non-trivial logic
   - **Complex**: unit + integration tests; fixture-based tests for AI pipelines
5. **Domain-specific checks** (apply those whose layer conventions are defined in the stack profile; skip `N/A`):
   - AI pipelines: test against reference fixtures at the stack's **Test fixtures location**, verify schema conformance
   - Database: run migration and verify per the stack's **Migrations + verify**
   - Frontend: verify the stack's **Module / layer structure** compliance, check module exports
6. **Validate** — run the stack profile's **Affected lint/test/build** command

**Quality Gate**: the stack's **Affected lint/test/build** command must pass.

If the gate fails:

1. Read the error output carefully
2. Fix the issues
3. Re-run the gate
4. Repeat until green — do not proceed with failures

**Commit Checkpoint**: Once the gate is green, present a commit plan (file groups + Conventional Commit messages) and wait for the human to commit. Do not run `git add` / `git commit` yourself. See `.github/git-workflow.md` → Commit Checkpoint.

---

### Phase ④ — Review

> All tiers. Depth varies by tier.

**Role**: `.ai/roles/reviewer.md`
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/review-code.md`
**Standards**: `.ai/standards/review.md`, `.ai/standards/coding.md`, `.ai/standards/security.md`

**Additional reviewers by condition** (read their role files and apply their perspective):

| Condition                               | Additional Role                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Task touches `auth` or `database` layer | `.ai/roles/security-engineer.md` |
| Task has `NFR-6.*` trace (GDPR)         | `.ai/roles/compliance.md`        |
| Task introduces new Nx boundary pattern | `.ai/roles/architect.md`         |
| Task SP >= 5 (Complex tier)             | `.ai/roles/architect.md`         |
| Task touches AI pipeline                | `.ai/roles/ai-engineer.md`       |

**Review depth by tier**:

| Tier     | Depth                                                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light    | Quick pass — correctness + boundary compliance                                                 |
| Standard | Full review — 5 dimensions (correctness, security, maintainability, performance, architecture) |
| Complex  | Deep review — all dimensions + domain expertise from specialist reviewers                      |

1. Review all changes from Phase ③ against the Task Brief / Design Spec
2. Evaluate across the 5 dimensions defined in `.ai/prompts/review-code.md`
3. Classify each finding: **Blocker** (must fix) / **Suggestion** (should consider) / **Nit** (optional)

**Output**: Review Report — use the format defined in `.ai/prompts/review-code.md`

**Quality Gate**: Zero Blockers remaining. The stack's **Affected lint/test/build** command still green after any fixes.

**On Blockers**:

1. Fix the issues (return to Phase ③ implementation)
2. Re-enter Phase ④ (re-review the fixes)
3. Maximum 3 review cycles — if still blocked after 3, escalate to user with the pattern of recurring issues

Each blocker-fix round is a separate commit — present a fresh commit plan and wait for the human to commit before re-entering review. See `.github/git-workflow.md` → Commit Checkpoint.

---

### Phase ⑤ — Test

> Standard + Complex only. Light tier tests are co-located in Phase ③.

**Role**: `.ai/roles/qa.md`
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/test-feature.md`
**Standards**: `.ai/standards/testing.md`

1. Verify test coverage meets expectations from the Design Spec test strategy
2. Domain-specific validation (apply those defined for this stack; skip `N/A`):
   - **AI pipeline**: run against reference fixtures, check schema conformance rate (target >95%), test failure modes and fallback behavior
   - **Frontend**: accessibility audit — keyboard navigation, aria labels, color independence, focus management
   - **API**: integration test via the stack's **Integration test harness**
   - **Database**: migration rollback test and **Access control** verification per the stack
3. Run the stack's **Affected tests only** command
4. For Complex tier: exploratory testing against acceptance criteria

**Output**: Test Report — use the format defined in `.ai/prompts/test-feature.md`

**Quality Gate**: All acceptance criteria verified. CI green. No accessibility blockers.

**On failure**:

1. Fix in Phase ③
2. Re-enter Phase ⑤
3. Maximum 3 test cycles — escalate if recurring

---

### Phase ⑥ — Security

> Complex only, plus any task touching `auth`, `database`, or `ai` layers regardless of tier.

**Role**: `.ai/roles/security-engineer.md` (+ `.ai/roles/compliance.md` if task has `NFR-6.*` trace)
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/security-assess.md`
**Standards**: `.ai/standards/security.md`

1. **Threat model** — identify attack surfaces introduced by this feature
2. **OWASP Top 10** — check changeset against relevant categories
3. **AI-specific** (for `ai` layer):
   - Prompt injection surface analysis
   - Output validation via the stack's **Validation / contracts** mechanism
   - Data leakage in system prompts or logs
4. **Database-specific** (for `database` layer):
   - **Access control** policy (per stack) covers all CRUD operations for new tables
   - Cascade / delete behavior verified
   - All data access through the stack's **Data access** layer (no raw/unsafe queries)
5. **Auth-specific** (for `auth` layer):
   - Session management follows the stack's **Auth mechanism**
   - OAuth redirect URIs scoped correctly
   - Token handling follows the stack's **Auth mechanism** best practices
6. **Dependency audit**: run the stack's **Dependency vulnerability audit** command. It scans
   the full resolved dependency tree, not only what this task added — a Critical reached
   transitively is exploitable regardless of who introduced it. Findings block per the gate
   below; an unfixable upstream advisory is a decision for the human, not a reason to
   narrow the scan

**Output**: Security Assessment — use the format defined in `.ai/prompts/security-assess.md`

**Quality Gate**: No Critical or High findings. Medium findings documented with mitigation plan.

---

### Phase ⑦ — Deploy

> Complex only. Light and Standard tasks deploy in batches per wave.

Follow the PR conventions in `.github/git-workflow.md`:

1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the feature branch
2. Open a PR using the stack's **Merge strategy** (PR title = commit message format)
3. Confirm the stack's **Target** preview is triggered
4. Verify the feature is accessible/functional per the stack's **Preview / verify gate**
5. Once CI is green and the preview is verified, merge into `main` per the stack's **Merge strategy**
6. Delete the feature branch

**Quality Gate**: PR merged. Production deploy succeeds. CI green on `main`.

---

### Phase ⑧ — Verify

> All tiers. Depth varies.

**Role**: `.ai/roles/business-analyst.md`
**Guide**: `.ai/prompts/verify-acceptance.md`

**Verification depth by tier**:

| Tier     | Depth                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light    | "Done when" spot check                                                      |
| Standard | Full "Done when" verification + user flow smoke test                        |
| Complex  | Full verification + user flow test + regression check on dependent features |

1. Walk through every acceptance criterion from the Task Brief
2. Verify each against the actual implementation (code review or deployed preview)
3. For Standard + Complex: smoke test the affected user flow
4. For Complex: regression check — verify dependent features still work

**Output**:

```
## Task {id} — Verification

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x / ] {criterion}: {evidence}

### Smoke Test: Pass / Fail / N/A (Light tier)
### Regressions: None / {findings}

### Status: PASSED / FAILED — {failing criteria}
```

**Quality Gate**: All acceptance criteria pass.

---

## Step 6 — Completion

After the final phase passes, save the task output and present a summary.

### 6a. Save Task Output

Create the file `.ai/sprints/sprint-{N}/tasks/{task-id}.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Task {id} — {name}

**Sprint**: {N} — Wave {M}
**Tier**: {tier} ({phase count} phases)
**Pipeline**: {list of phase numbers executed}
**Status**: PASSED / FAILED
**Branch**: {branch name}

## Task Brief

{Summary from Phase ①: trace, acceptance criteria, constraints}

## Design Decisions

{Key decisions made during implementation — or "N/A" for Light tier}

## Artifacts

- Code changes: {list of files created or modified}
- Review: {verdict — Approved, findings summary}
- Test Report: {pass / fail summary, or N/A for Light}
- Security Assessment: {verdict, or N/A}
- Verification: {N}/{N} acceptance criteria passed

## Metrics

| Metric              | Value                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Total phases        | {count of phases executed}                             |
| Gate failures       | {count — list which phases failed and how many cycles} |
| Review cycles       | {N (max 3 before escalation)}                          |
| Files changed       | {count of files created + modified}                    |
| Lines changed       | {+N / -N from git diff --stat}                         |
| Lint errors         | {0 or count at final gate}                             |
| Test count          | {number of tests run, or N/A for Light}                |
| Build status        | {pass / fail}                                          |
| Human interventions | {count}                                                |

## Human Interventions

{Log every point where the human corrected, redirected, or refined the agent's approach. For each intervention:}

- **{phase or step}**: {what the agent did or proposed} → {what the human corrected it to} — **Lesson**: {generalizable takeaway for the framework}

{If no interventions occurred, write "None — pipeline ran without human correction."}
```

### 6b. Update Sprint Progress

Update `docs/specs/sprint-{N}-progress.md`:

1. Set the task's Status column to `Done` (or `Failed`) with branch name and brief notes
2. Update the Summary section (done count, SP completed)
3. Update the Current Wave pointer
4. Set `**Last updated**` to today's date

If the progress file does not exist yet, create it from `docs/specs/sprint-progress-template.md`.

### 6c. Present Summary

Output the summary to the conversation:

```
## Task {id} Complete

**Name**: {name}
**Sprint**: {N} — Wave {M}
**Tier**: {tier} ({phase count} phases)
**Pipeline**: {list of phase numbers executed}
**Output**: `.ai/sprints/sprint-{N}/tasks/{task-id}.md`
**Progress**: `docs/specs/sprint-{N}-progress.md` updated
```

## Failure Escalation

| Situation                                   | Action                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unmet dependency                            | **STOP** — report which task(s) must complete first and what's missing       |
| Ambiguous requirement                       | **STOP** — present the ambiguity and ask user to clarify                     |
| 3+ review/test cycles with recurring issues | **Escalate** — present the issue pattern and request architectural guidance  |
| Scope creep (task larger than SP estimate)  | **Flag** — report the scope increase and let user decide to split or proceed |
| External blocker (API down, tool broken)    | **STOP** — document the blocker and suggest workaround                       |
| CI flake (passes on retry)                  | Note it, proceed, but log for retrospective                                  |
