# Stack Profile — `<stack name>`

Defines the language- and framework-specific commands and conventions that the SDLC
pipeline (`.github/prompts/run-task.prompt.md`) invokes **by reference**. The pipeline
orchestration — phases, tiers, gates, roles, commit checkpoint — is stack-neutral;
everything a phase needs to _do concretely_ for a given stack lives here.

**One active profile per project/branch**, at `docs/specs/stack.md`. Copy this template to
that path and fill every field. A different branch = a different `stack.md`; the pipeline on
`main` is never edited per stack.

> The build/impact engine stays **Nx** across stacks (it delegates to the underlying build
> tool via `@nx/js`, `@nx/gradle`, etc.). This profile fills in the language/framework
> specifics Nx does not know about.

## Identity

| Field                        | Value                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Language                     | <e.g. TypeScript 5 / Java 21>     |
| Framework                    | <e.g. Next.js 15 / Spring Boot 3> |
| Nx plugin                    | <e.g. @nx/js / @nx/gradle>        |
| Package / dependency manager | <e.g. pnpm / Gradle>              |

## Commands

The pipeline calls these by name. Fill each with the concrete command for this stack.

| Purpose                              | Command                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scaffold new lib/module              | <e.g. `pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib …` / `pnpm nx g @nx/gradle:app …`>       |
| Affected lint/test/build (main gate) | <e.g. `pnpm nx affected -t lint,test,build`>                         |
| Affected tests only                  | <e.g. `pnpm nx affected -t test`>                                    |
| Dependency vulnerability audit       | <e.g. `pnpm audit` / `pnpm nx affected -t dependency-check` (OWASP)> |

## Conventions (per layer)

Fill each. Mark `N/A` for a layer this stack does not have, and `Not selected` for one it
has but has not decided — the pipeline skips the first and surfaces the second.

| Concern                  | This stack's mechanism                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validation / contracts   | <e.g. Zod schemas / Jakarta Bean Validation + records>                        |
| Data access              | <e.g. Drizzle ORM, no raw SQL / Spring Data JPA, no raw SQL>                  |
| Migrations + verify      | <e.g. Drizzle migrations, `supabase status` / Flyway, `./gradlew flywayInfo`> |
| Access control           | <e.g. Postgres RLS per table / Spring Security method + row rules>            |
| Module / layer structure | <e.g. FSD (frontend) / package-by-feature or hexagonal>                       |
| Auth mechanism           | <e.g. Supabase-native sessions & tokens / Spring Security + OAuth2/JWT>       |
| Test fixtures location   | <e.g. `__fixtures__/` / `src/test/resources/fixtures`>                        |
| Integration test harness | <e.g. local Supabase / Testcontainers>                                        |

## Deploy

| Field                 | Value                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target                | <e.g. Vercel / container image to registry → k8s>       |
| Preview / verify gate | <e.g. Vercel preview URL verified / staging smoke test> |
| Merge strategy        | <e.g. squash-merge to `main`>                           |

## Notes

- Every row needs a value, and three kinds count as one:
  - a concrete command or convention;
  - `N/A — <why>`: the check does not apply to this stack, so the pipeline **skips** it;
  - `Not selected — <who decides it>`: it applies and is undecided, so the pipeline
    **surfaces** it instead. An outstanding decision is a finding, not an exemption, and
    collapsing the two into `N/A` is how a decision nobody made becomes a check nobody runs.
- Do not delete a row, and do not leave one blank. A deleted row cannot be looked up by the
  name a phase reads, and a blank one is indistinguishable from both markers above. Either
  way the phase check is skipped in silence, which is the one thing none of the three mean.
