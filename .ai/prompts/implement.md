# Prompt: Implement (Phase ③)

## Purpose

Write the code, tests, and documentation that deliver the task.

## Tiers

All tiers. Input and test depth vary by tier.

## Composition Blocks

| Block               | Source                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ① Role Identity     | Specialist by layer (see routing below)          |
| ② Task Template     | `tasks/implement-feature.md`                     |
| ③ Standards         | `standards/coding.md`, `standards/testing.md`    |
| ④ Iteration Context | Roadmap section + task row                       |
| ⑤ Input Artifacts   | Light: Task Brief. Standard/Complex: Design Spec |
| ⑥ Output Format     | Committed code + passing CI                      |

### Agent Routing by Layer

| Task Layer    | Primary Agent     | Support Agent                |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `monorepo`    | Implementer       | —                            |
| `frontend`    | Implementer       | —                            |
| `database`    | Database Engineer | —                            |
| `api`         | Implementer       | —                            |
| `auth`        | Implementer       | Security Engineer (advisory) |
| `infra`, `ci` | DevOps Engineer   | —                            |
| `ai`          | AI Engineer       | —                            |
| `testing`     | QA Engineer       | —                            |
| `docs`        | Implementer       | —                            |

For a cross-layer task written `<a>+<b>`, the first layer named supplies the primary
agent and the second contributes as support.

Add additional layer mappings for your project's domain-specific concerns.

## Phase Instructions

1. **Scaffold** — Use `{package-manager} nx g` for new files/projects where applicable
2. **Build** — Implement code following the Design Spec file plan (or Task Brief for Light tier)
3. **Test** — Write co-located tests at depth matching the tier:
   - Light: minimal — contract validation (schema validates, export resolves)
   - Standard: unit tests for non-trivial logic
   - Complex: unit + integration tests
4. **Validate** — Run `{package-manager} nx lint` and `{package-manager} nx test` on affected projects
5. **Domain-specific checks**:
   - Database: run migration locally, verify schema state
   - Frontend: verify component hierarchy compliance, check barrel exports
   - API: verify endpoint contracts against schema
6. **Commit** — Conventional commit message following `{commit-conventions-doc}`

## Quality Gate

- `{package-manager} nx affected -t lint,test,build` passes
- Implementation matches Design Spec file plan (Standard/Complex) or Task Brief acceptance criteria (Light)
- No secrets committed, no hardcoded configuration
- Conventional commit message
