# Prompt: Design Spec (Phase ②)

## Purpose

Define _how_ the task will be built — file paths, interfaces, data flow — before writing code.

## Tiers

Standard and Complex only. Light tier skips to Phase ③.

## Composition Blocks

| Block               | Source                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ① Role Identity     | `roles/architect.md` + specialist by layer                |
| ② Task Template     | — (phase-specific instructions below)                     |
| ③ Standards         | `standards/architecture.md`, `standards/nx-boundaries.md` |
| ④ Iteration Context | Roadmap section + task row                                |
| ⑤ Input Artifacts   | Task Brief from Phase ①                                   |
| ⑥ Output Format     | Design Spec template below                                |

### Co-Designer by Layer

| Task Layer            | Co-Designer       | Role File                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `database`            | Database Engineer | `roles/database-engineer.md` |
| `frontend`            | Implementer       | `roles/implementer.md`       |
| `auth`, `infra`, `ci` | DevOps Engineer   | `roles/devops.md`            |
| `api`                 | Architect solo    | —                            |
| `ai`                  | AI Engineer       | `roles/ai-engineer.md`       |
| `testing`             | QA Engineer       | `roles/qa.md`                |
| `monorepo`, `docs`    | Architect solo    | —                            |

For a cross-layer task written `<a>+<b>` (e.g. `auth+api`), apply every matching row; the
first layer named leads the design. Add specialist mappings for domain-specific layers, and
add the layer to the canonical list in the roadmap template before using it in a task row.

## Phase Instructions

1. Architect determines the minimal correct solution approach
2. Specialist co-designer validates domain-specific decisions
3. Confirm Nx boundary compliance — which `scope:*` and `type:*` tags are involved, verify no violations
4. For Complex tier: determine if an ADR is needed (new pattern, new dependency, new trade-off)
5. Identify risks and their mitigations
6. Define test strategy (what to test, where, fixtures needed)

## Output Format — Design Spec

```markdown
## Design Spec: {task_id} — {task_name}

### Approach

{1-3 paragraph description of how this will be built}

### Files to Create/Modify

| File     | Action        | Purpose   |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `{path}` | Create/Modify | {purpose} |

### Interfaces / Contracts

{TypeScript interfaces or schemas that define boundaries between components}

### Data Flow

{Mermaid sequence diagram showing how data moves through the system}

### Nx Boundary Verification

- Scope tags involved: {list}
- Cross-boundary imports: {list with justification}
- Violations: none

### ADR Required: {yes — ADR-NNN | no}

### Risks

| Risk   | Likelihood        | Mitigation   |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| {risk} | {low/medium/high} | {mitigation} |

### Test Strategy

- Unit: {what to test, where}
- Integration: {what to test, where}
- Fixtures needed: {yes/no — description}
```

## Quality Gate

- **Complex tier**: Design Spec reviewed and approved by human before implementation
- **Standard tier**: Auto-proceed unless architectural risk flagged (new pattern or boundary change)
