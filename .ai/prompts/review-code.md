# Prompt: Review Code (Phase ④)

## Purpose

Verify correctness, security, maintainability, performance, and architectural compliance.

## Tiers

All tiers. Review depth and reviewer count vary by tier.

## Composition Blocks

| Block               | Source                                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ① Role Identity     | `roles/reviewer.md` + specialist(s) by condition                      |
| ② Task Template     | `tasks/review-pr.md`                                                  |
| ③ Standards         | `standards/review.md`, `standards/coding.md`, `standards/security.md` |
| ④ Iteration Context | Roadmap section + task row                                            |
| ⑤ Input Artifacts   | Git diff/changeset from Phase ③ + Design Spec (if exists)             |
| ⑥ Output Format     | Review Report template below                                          |

### Reviewer Depth by Tier

| Tier     | Reviewers                       | Depth                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Light    | Code Reviewer only              | Quick pass — correctness + boundaries           |
| Standard | Code Reviewer + 0-1 specialist  | Standard review — 5 dimensions                  |
| Complex  | Code Reviewer + 1-2 specialists | Deep review — all dimensions + domain expertise |

### Additional Reviewer Conditions

| Condition                                   | Additional Reviewer             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Task touches `auth` or `database` layer     | Security Engineer               |
| Task has compliance/regulatory requirements | Compliance Checker (if defined) |
| Task introduces new Nx boundary pattern     | Architect                       |
| Change tiered `T3` by the gate              | Architect                       |

## Phase Instructions

1. Code Reviewer evaluates across 5 dimensions:
   - **Correctness**: Does it do what the Task Brief / Design Spec says?
   - **Security**: Input validation, no secrets, no injection surface?
   - **Maintainability**: Clear code, appropriate abstraction level, no dead code?
   - **Performance**: No N+1 queries, no unnecessary re-renders, efficient algorithms?
   - **Architecture**: Nx boundaries respected, layer direction correct, ADR adherence?
2. Classify each finding: **Blocker** (must fix) / **Suggestion** (should consider) / **Nit** (optional)
3. Specialist reviewers add domain-specific checks per their role definitions

## Output Format — Review Report

```markdown
## Review: {task_id} — {task_name}

### Reviewers

- Code Reviewer: {pass/changes_requested}
- {Specialist}: {pass/changes_requested}

### Blockers (must fix before merge)

- [ ] {issue} — `{file_path}:{line}` — {explanation}

### Suggestions (should consider)

- {improvement} — `{file_path}:{line}` — {rationale}

### Nits (optional, take or leave)

- {style item}

### Positive Observations

- {what was done well — specific praise}

### Verdict: {Approved | Changes Requested}
```

## Quality Gate

- Zero Blockers remaining
- All Blockers fixed and re-reviewed
- `{package-manager} nx affected -t lint,test,build` still green after fixes
